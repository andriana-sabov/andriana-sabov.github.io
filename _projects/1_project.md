The present study aims to address how modulating SWS influences lexical learning and in particular the integration of newly learned words into the lexicon, or lexical-semantic consolidation. Specifically, we will investigate whether reducing the quality and propagation of slow waves in young neurotypical speakers - by means of targeted auditory stimulation during sleep (Fehér et al., 2023) - impairs the transfer of memory traces from the hippocampus to neocortical language networks (as assessed by fMRI), thereby hindering the integration of newly learned vocabulary into existing lexical-semantic networks. The study will involve young adults as a proxy to the diminished SWS and less coordinated sleep spindle and slow wave activity that have been described in older adults in order to replicate the reduced lexical learning observed with aging.
